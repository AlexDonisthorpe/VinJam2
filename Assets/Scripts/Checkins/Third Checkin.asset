  successText: "So, you\u2019ve been keeping busy I see. Good, well I think it\u2019s
    time to ramp things up with some more houses to haunt. Also I\u2019ve seen a
    party ghost hanging around these parts, I\u2019ve spoken with HR but they can\u2019t
    find his boss so don\u2019t let me catch any of your ghosts dancing with that
    slacker or you\u2019ll be in trouble!"
  failText: "What\u2019s this!? You couldn\u2019t haunt these houses in time! I knew
    it, I knew you were a slacker! Well luckily for me I have you now for all eternity
    as your retirement is now cancelled!"
